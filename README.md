# Percolator

**EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECT — NOT PRODUCTION READY. NOT AUDITED. Do NOT use with real funds.**

Current normative spec: [`spec.md`](spec.md), **v13.0.0**.

Percolator is a perpetual-futures risk-engine library for account-local,
permissionless risk progress. v13 removes the finite global account slab: every
portfolio account is a distinct authenticated account bound to a market group,
and safety depends on bounded full-account refresh plus fail-closed stale
states, not on scanning every account in the market.

The core promise is narrower and more realistic than global auto-discovery:
if an honest crank supplies a valid account hint, the engine can make bounded
progress on that account, while omitted or stale accounts cannot extract value
or increase risk using optimistic health.

## Three Invariants

1. **Backed exits:** protected principal is senior, positive PnL is junior, and no withdrawal can claim more value than the balance sheet can pay.
2. **Account-local safety:** every favorable action refreshes the account's full active portfolio first; hidden, stale, or B-stale legs fail closed.
3. **Bounded progress:** cranks and recovery paths are account-local and incremental; no public instruction needs to evaluate the whole market.

## Account-Local v13

Each `PortfolioAccountV13` carries provenance:

```text
market_group_id
portfolio_account_id
owner
version/layout discriminator
```

The engine rejects any account whose provenance does not match the
`MarketGroupV13`. Active positions are defined only by the canonical active
bitmap and bounded leg array. There is no hidden slab slot and no global account
table to scan.

The account-local bounded work unit is a full portfolio refresh over at most
`MAX_PORTFOLIO_ASSETS_N` configured legs. A fresh health certificate is required
for user-favorable actions. If an account is stale, B-stale, under h-max/stress,
or loss-stale, favorable paths must reject or use conservative no-positive-credit
lanes.

## H-Lock

Capital is senior. Profit is junior. `h_min` may be zero while the market is
healthy, but h-lock selection is state-derived and permissionless:

- `h_min` is used only when no h-max condition is active.
- `h_max` is used under threshold stress, bankruptcy h-lock, instruction-local
  bankruptcy candidates, loss-stale catchup, stale/B-stale account state, or
  active bankrupt close state.

Wrappers do not choose h-lock from an oracle. They supply authenticated market
inputs; the engine selects the lane from committed market/account state.

## A/K/F/B

v13 keeps the lazy index model but makes bankruptcy residuals explicit:

- **A** scales effective quantity for side-level quantity ADL.
- **K/F** represent mark and funding settlement.
- **B** books bankruptcy residual loss through account-local chunks.

Account-local B settlement is bounded. A public endpoint must either apply the
engine-determined positive chunk, leave the account B-stale, or route to
permissionless recovery if no positive chunk is representable. B-stale accounts
cannot withdraw, close favorably, convert/release PnL, use hedge credit, increase
risk, or receive resolved payout.

## Crank And Recovery

Public user-fund markets are `CrankForward`. An account-free equity-active crank
is forbidden unless it also commits bounded protective progress. Candidate lists
are hints, not proofs of completeness: missing accounts do not make a crank
unsafe, and hinted unhealthy accounts must either make bounded progress or route
to recovery.

If ordinary bounded progress cannot continue, the public recovery API records a
deterministic recovery reason. The caller does not choose a recovery price.

## Proofs

The current v13 proof suite is intentionally account-local and runs over the
production v13 methods:

```bash
cargo install --locked kani-verifier
cargo kani setup
scripts/run_kani_full_audit.sh
```

The latest checked timing sweep is in:

```text
kani_audit_full.tsv
kani_audit_final.tsv
scripts/proof-strength-audit-results.md
```

The v12 slab proof inventory was retired with the v13 cutover because it no
longer applies to the architecture.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test
cargo test --features test
```

## Scope

This repository is a pure risk-engine library. It does not define an on-chain
program id, account decoder, persisted market registry, or deployment manifest.
Wrappers own authorization, account loading, oracle/funding authentication,
fee-schedule policy, and raw-state layout migration.
