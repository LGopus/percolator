# Kani Proof Strength Audit Results

Kani version: `cargo-kani 0.66.0`.

## Full Kani Timing Sweep

Command:

```text
scripts/run_kani_full_audit.sh
```

The v13 cutover removed the v12 slab and retired the v12 proof inventory. The
sweep now parses the remaining `tests/proofs_*.rs` files and runs each v13
harness one-by-one with exact harness selection and a `600s` timeout.

## Static Strength Scan

Inventory by file:

| File | Harnesses |
|---|---:|
| `tests/proofs_v13.rs` | 22 |

Strength indicators:

| Check | Result |
|---|---:|
| Harnesses over v13 production code | 22 |
| Harnesses with symbolic inputs or symbolic branch choices | 9 |
| Harnesses with `kani::cover!` reachability checks | 8 |
| Explicit `kani::assume(false)` / `assume(false)` findings | 0 |
| Confirmed vacuous harnesses | 0 |
| Confirmed weak harnesses | 0 |

Current classification:

| Classification | Status |
|---|---|
| Non-vacuity | No confirmed vacuous harnesses found. Cover checks exercise h-min/h-max, stale set/clear, hidden-leg rejection, and B-chunk progress paths. |
| Weak proofs | No confirmed weak proofs in the v13 inventory. |
| Inductive strength | The stale-counter proof is close to an account-local inductive transition proof. The remaining proofs are strong production-code safety/liveness harnesses, not a complete arbitrary-state inductive proof system. |
| Practical proof boundary | The suite proves key v13 account-local invariants over the real production methods: h-lock state selection, provenance/hidden-leg fail-closed behavior, stale counter idempotence and refresh clearing, i128::MIN rejection, B-chunk progress/fail-closed behavior, full-refresh gating, monotonic liquidation-score rejection, loss-before-fee ordering, account-free equity-active accrual protective-progress gating, one-segment bounded catchup, dynamic trade-fee cap enforcement, h-lock risk-increase rejection, h-lock risk-reducing trade liveness under no-positive-credit margin, h-lock withdrawal no-positive-credit gating, loss-stale nonflat withdrawal blocking, resolved positive-payout snapshot fairness, durable B residual booking, prior-epoch reset clearing, and quantity-ADL OI symmetry. |

## Rust Test Matrix

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test` | PASS |
| `cargo test --features test` | PASS |

The Rust suite currently covers 50 wide-math unit tests and 32 v13 spec tests.

## Audit Conclusion

All v13 Kani proofs pass within the 10-minute per-harness cap, and no weak or
vacuous proof was identified in this pass. The proof boundary is intentionally
v13 account-local and now covers the newly implemented production paths for
fee/loss ordering, accrual progress gating, one-segment bounded catchup,
residual B booking, stale-certificate refresh clearing, reset lifecycle,
quantity ADL, dynamic trade fees, h-lock risk-increase rejection, h-lock
risk-reducing trade liveness, h-lock withdrawal no-positive-credit admission,
loss-stale nonflat withdrawal blocking, resolved payout snapshot fairness, and
permissionless account-local progress. The retired v12 slab proofs no longer
apply after the architectural cutover.
